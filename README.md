> My personal portfolio is a responsive web app that I used to present my skills, projects and other details about myself. It also contains a form that can be used to reach out to me directly.

## Built With

- Nextjs
- Tailwind

## Live Demo



## Getting Started

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/joel-kalema/me_with-nextjs.git
    npm install
    npm run dev

You also need to enable `localhost:3000` in your CORS Origins settings!

Note: If you are running on Windows run install --noptional flag (i.e. `npm install --no-optional`) which will skip installing fsevents.


If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.
