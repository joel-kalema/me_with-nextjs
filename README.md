To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

You also need to enable `localhost:3000` in your CORS Origins settings!

Note: If you are running on Windows run install --noptional flag (i.e. `npm install --no-optional`) which will skip installing fsevents.


If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm run dev`:

    npm run dev

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.
